## Concepts/Methods/...

### Dynamic Import

Load a module asynchronously and dynamically.

The import() syntax, commonly called dynamic import, is a function-like expression that allows loading an ECMAScript module asynchronously and dynamically into a potentially non-module environment.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import>

### error.cause

Indicate the specific original cause of the error.

The cause data property of an Error instance indicates the specific original cause of the error.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause>

### Hashbang Grammar

Provide the path to a specific JavaScript interpreter that you want to use to execute the script.

This page describes JavaScript's lexical grammar. JavaScript source text is just a sequence of characters — in order for the interpreter to understand it, the string has to be parsed to a more structured representation. The initial step of parsing is called lexical analysis, in which the text gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of individual, atomic input elements. Some input elements are insignificant to the interpreter, and will be stripped after this step — they include white space and comments. The others, including identifiers, keywords, literals, and punctuators (mostly operators), will be used for further syntax analysis. Line terminators and multiline comments are also syntactically insignificant, but they guide the process for automatic semicolons insertion to make certain invalid token sequences become valid.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar>

### Regexp Match Indices

Store the start and end positions of each matched capture group.

The hasIndices accessor property of RegExp instances returns whether or not the d flag is used with this regular expression.

### array.with()

Returns a new array with the element at the given index replaced with the given value.

The with() method of Array instances is the copying version of using the bracket notation to change the value of a given index. It returns a new array with the element at the given index replaced with the given value.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/with>

### array.toSpliced()

### WebXR Device API

WebXR is a group of standards which are used together to support rendering 3D scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds (virtual reality, or VR), or for adding graphical imagery to the real world, (augmented reality, or AR). The WebXR Device API implements the core of the WebXR feature set, managing the selection of output devices, render the 3D scene to the chosen device at the appropriate frame rate, and manage motion vectors created using input controllers.

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API>

### Gamepad API

The Gamepad API is a way for developers to access and respond to signals from gamepads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
